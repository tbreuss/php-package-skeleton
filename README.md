# PHP Package Skeleton

This skeleton is a concrete example package based on [PDS Skeleton][php-pds]. 
It uses the standard filesystem structure as proposed by PDS and adds some additional folders and files.
The main idea is to create a project using this package and then remove the parts that are not used or not useful for your project.

## Installation

To create a new project based on this skeleton package simply run the following command: 

    $ composer create-project -s dev tebe/php-package-skeleton myproject

Now, remove the parts from the created project that are not used or not useful for your project.

## Summary

The package contains the following root-level directories:

| Directory              | Description                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `bin/`                 | command-line executables                      |
| `config/`              | configuration files                           |

| `vendor/`              | vendor files managed by composer              |

The package contains the following root-level files:
